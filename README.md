### Welcome to Filsan's git ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: filsanhassan99@gmail.com

This summer I decided to explore the world of programming through webdevelopment. Below is my journey so far : 

## Start

I started this journey by working through the following Udemy Courses:
[WebdevBootcamp](https://github.com/FilsanH/UdemyWebdevbootcamp.git),
[Javascript](https://github.com/FilsanH/JavascriptCourse-.git)

## Next 

I was particularly interested in back-end webdevelopment so chose to explore this further.
[Node.js](https://github.com/FilsanH/Node.js---The-Complete-Guide-.git)

## Next 

I decided to take a break from the courses and consolidate by learning completing the following projects.

Javascript:
https://github.com/FilsanH/Javascript_daily.git

Node.js: 
https://github.com/FilsanH/StroyBookPublic.git, 
https://github.com/FilsanH/Node_Practice.git


## Highlight 

I developed a chrome extension  ['Additive Agumenter'](https://github.com/FilsanH/AAChromeExtension.git) to help make your facebook browsing experience a little more productive. I hope to soon publish it! 

## Future Plans

I hope to complete the Node.js Udemy course and make my own website from the ground up. Stay tuned!
