## Start

I started this journey by working through the Udemy Courses below:

## Next 

I was particularly interested in back-end webdevelopment so chose to explore this further.

## Next 

I decided to take a break from the courses and consolidate by learning completing the following projects.

Node.js: 
https://github.com/FilsanH/StroyBookPublic.git
